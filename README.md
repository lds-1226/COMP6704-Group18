Group 08  
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University  

## Project Overview
We compare three classic Deep Q-Network variants on the **Bombers** (a Pommerman-like) environment:

- Vanilla DQN  
- Dueling DDQN  
- Prioritized Experience Replay DQN (Prioritized DQN)

The multi-agent Bombers environment is provided by:
